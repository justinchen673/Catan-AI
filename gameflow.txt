INITIAL SETUP

1. Determine who goes first
2. Print board
3. Request settlement from player
4. Print board
5. Request road from player
6. Loop through 2 through 5 through the list, and then do it again backwards.

GAMEPLAY

1. Roll the dice
    a. Everyone automatically picks up cards
    b. If it's a 7, run through people with more than 7 cards and ask what they
       want to discard. Then, ask what hex the current player wants to put the
       robber on.
2. Several different options for the player now.
    - Request a trade
        a. Select player
        b. Select resource to GIVE
        c. Select number of resources to GIVE
        d. Select resource to TAKE
        e. Select number of resources to TAKE
        f. Confirm trade
    - Trade with the bank (take into account ports)
        a. Select resource to GIVE
        b. Select number of resources to GIVE
        c. Select resource to TAKE
        d. If the trade is legal, it will be done.
    - Build something
        a. Select settlement, city, road, or dev card.
        b. Settlement will ask what vertex you want to place it on.
        c. City will print the board again marking your settlements 1-n
        d. Road will ask between what two vertices
        e. Dev card will give you a random development card from the deck.
    - Use development cards
        a. Depending on type, different action will take place
