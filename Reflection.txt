Experience with Catan AI Project - Nicholas Jung

During the Spring Semester of 2019, I was happy to take part in the Catan AI project led by Justin Chen,
along with team member Ishita Padhiar.

At the start of the semester, we started from scratch and were inspired by the game of Catan, which we
usually played for hours on end. We thought, for an RCOS project, why not create an AI that can simulate
a Catan game for us? After all it was a simple game to play but had so many strategies within it. Since this
was the second time for me doing RCOS, I believed that we could learn a lot more about game AI and see
if it was something I was interested in.

 We started off with developing the implementation of the game. Before we could create an AI, we needed to
 have a game that we can run the AI on. Hence, I took part in helping Justin with the implementation of
 Catan, while Ishita resaearched more about Catan AI. This was a difficult task for me, since I knew much less
 about coding than Justin. However, I believed that I learned more about game design and logic after working with
 Justin. 
 
 Once the game implementation was finished, Justin and Ishita worked more towards development of an AI, while I 
 worked on debugging and error testing with specific functions. 
 
 I think Catan AI has opened me up more into understanding how game AI works and how it can be implemented from
 a student perspective. I've learned a lot more about software and logic and its applications outside of class.
 For the Fall semester I will join RCOS again and focus on finding another project somewhat related so I could
 learn more about coding.
