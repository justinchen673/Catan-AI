	In short these posts break down the probabilities of winning using all the possible
	strategies/ combinations of points, calculating the cost of those points and then the
	probabilities of getting those necessary points of average.

	Essentially the most straightforward AI we could make would re calculate the
	probabilities each turn using the settlements it is near and then using those
	probabilities calculate the method with the highest chance of winning for it.


*************************************************************************************
AI Model:
*************************************************************************************

Overview:

	There are a 114 different combinations of points that can be used to win the game

	Each of them have different costs associated with the (i.e. the raw number of
	development cards needed to get those points)
		For example- Say you win with Largest Army, Longest Road and 3 cities. In the best
		case scenario that means that you only needed to draw 34 cards
			3 Knights = 3 Sheep, 3 Ore, 3 Wheat
			3 Road = 3 Wood, 3 Brick
				> This is assuming that you connect the two original settlements and their
				  roads to win
			1 Settlement = 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick
			3 Cities = 6 Wheat, 9 Ore
				Total = 4 Sheep, 12 Ore, 10 Wheat, 4 Brick, 4 Wood

	We should probably preload these wins and the cards they need in order to speed up the
	calculations

	After picking the best method to win, organize the order of getting each based on
	dependencies and cards that are easier to get (Top sort or something similar)



	Start, Placing Settlements:
		Using the winning combinations, look that the probabilities for each of the
		placements (and the resources around them) for getting the cards you need to win the
		fastest.

			For the easy mode just look at simple probabilities of each resource at each
			spot and total the raw number of cards/ rolls needed to win

			For the hard mode perform a more complex analysis of what will happen through
			the moves- ex. when you build a city, you will start picking up two of each
			resource rather than one which increase the frequency of that resource. Also
			factor in ports and how that help trading and access to resources.



	Middle, Your Turn:
		Two modes-
			Easy- Only calculates deals with the best strategies and winning methods for
			itself, and plays accordingly
				Will trade generally, not asking specific players for specific things
				Will not keep track of how close others are to winning, and try to stop them
				Will not keep track of how a trade might benefit another player, just if it
				would be beneficial to them
				Will place the robber unbiasedly at the most likely/ most populated
				intersection

			Hard- Calculates probabilities/ best method for winning not only for itself but
			also for all other players
				Will trade specifically with other players, choosing to trade with the
				loosing player, or propose a trade to a player that will hurt their chances
				of winning
				Will not trade with a player if that makes them significantly closer to
				winning
				Will keep track of all the cards the players have picked up in the past
				three (subject to change, we can pick any number of turn we think is good)
				turns to  calculate probabilities
				Will place the robber to try to hurt the player currently in the lead

				Essentially it will actively fight the others to try to hurt their chances
				of winning


			1) Check to make sure the strategy being used currently is still the best one
			   for victory
			2) Given a strategy, try to accomplish the tasks based on the cards you have
			   and the dependencies for the other steps
			3)If you can't accomplish any of the tasks with your cards propose trades to get
			  to where you want to be
			4)Based on the number of cards you have and the probability of gaining more over
			  the 7 that are allowed and taking into account the probability of rolling a
			  seven, decide whether to 'waste' cards by doing something that isn't
			  necessarily a part of your strategy, for example buy a unintended dev card or
			  build an extra road



	Middle, Other Players Turns:
		Recalculate probabilities based on every resource card revealed/ picked from the deck

		If trades are offered recalculate probabilities if that path is taken
			> In the hard mode recalculate probabilities for the other player as well as for
			yourself, in the easy mode just you



	Ending:
		Hard- If other players are close to winning, abandon the highest probability for your
		win strategies in place of strategies that will guarantee the quickest win, even if
		they are more risky
