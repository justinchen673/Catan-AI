STRATEGIES
********************************************************************************

NOTE: In practice, the bot should use a combination of the following strategies.

1. Ore / Wheat
    - Obtain much ore and grain early on for cities
    - Ore is more valuable (3 to 2) and less ore hexes
    - Helpful to have cities on initial settlements, since those are usually the
      best ones
    - Try to make the cities around 3 relatively good hexes instead of 2 bad
      ones and 1 super good one to counter the robber
    - Largest army is a goal here, but save knights to counter the robber
    - Drawbacks are inability to expand
    - Ideal winning scenario is 4 cities and largest army

2. Wood / Brick
    - Build settlements and roads
    - Wood / brick port is very important
    - Longest road is a goal here
    - New settlements should go for wheat and ore, or ports that allow for such
      trading

3. Card Builder
    - Similar to ore / wheat, where you get 2 quick cities and go for dev cards.
    - At some point, go for a third settlement / city

4. Balance
    - Balance all 5 resources
    - A 3:1 port is very useful
    - Flexible for changing into other strategies from this one

5. Rare Resource
    - Look for the rarest resource on the board and place your settlements there
    - Rarity types:
        - Rare in overall production (low numbers on those tiles)
        - Rare in position availability (ore and brick have 3 hexes only)
    - This is NOT a monopoly strategy, just attempt to obtain them.

6. Straight Numerical Advantage
    - Go for straight up best production
    - Only good for early game if you don't really know what to do, but this is
      NOT a strategy really, this will evolve into the other strategies.

********************************************************************************
SETUP FACTORS
********************************************************************************

1. Production Value
    - Most important factor: consider other factors after this
    - Easy algorithm for ranking: subtract each of the three adjacent numbers by
      7, add those up, and subtract that from 18. High numbers are good.

2. Strategy Type
    - Weigh the resources. Straight production value isn't a strategy by itself.

3. 6 and 8
    - If two vertices have the same ranking, but one has a 6 or 8, DON'T go for
      it. They attract robbers and other people.
    - If your plan involves many knights (card builder), this isn't as bad.

4. Settlement Placement Around 1 Hex
    - In general, don't do it because of the robber, if they're both yours
    - If others are on it, that could be good though because those players want
      the robber off as well.

5. Other Players
    - If you go first, you may not be able to figure out your strategy until
      you place the second settlement.

6. Number Distribution
    - Having two 5's gives the same probability as a 4 and 6, but the two 5's
      could be better since they can be immediately used, but if the 6 is a
      better resource, go for that instead.

7. Road Placement
    - Safe: Build towards the sea and ports
    - Risky: Build towards the inland
        - If you do this, figure out if people can get there first
        - Take into account the strategy you're using. Wood / Brick are best
          suited for this playstyle, ore / wheat not so much.

8. Connecting Settlements
    - Mostly only applicable for longest road players
    - Wait to do this until the later game
    - If you're doing ore / wheat, may as well just put the settlements in two
      completely different locations.

********************************************************************************
EARLY GAME
********************************************************************************

1. Grow
    - Growth is exponential, not linear.
    - So, for early game, focus on increasing production

2. Early Numbers
    - The numbers in the beginning are way more important than the later ones
      due to exponential growth rate.
    - Early robber is also more effective.

3. Number Clumping
    - This actually happens a lot, when it seems the same number gets rolled
      over and over again.
    - Spread out early production centers on different numbers, ESPECIALLY if
      you have a city based strategy like ore / wheat.

********************************************************************************
PORTS
********************************************************************************

1. Highly Essential
    - You almost certainly need a port to win. Early on they're not too
      important, but don't get blocked off either.
    - Try to start near a port or maybe even on one.

2. Port Type
    - Port type depends on the strategy being used.
    - This also means that 3:1 ports could be better than 2:1 ports.

3. First Turn Ports
    - If you have a great hex with a good number right next to a 2:1 port of
      that resource, that would be a good spot.
    - Don't do this for the second settlement, as it takes away your starting
      number of cards.

********************************************************************************
LARGEST ARMY / LONGEST ROAD
********************************************************************************

1. Highly Essential
    - You almost certainly need one or the other to win.

2. Be A Contrarian
    - Note what resources the competition can get easily, and base your strategy
      around going for other types of resources. It's a lot harder to get
      largest army if someone else is doing that.

3. Longest Road Side Trips
    - Try to avoid side trips if going for the longest road. This reduces the
      size of your road, and you only have 15 max.

********************************************************************************
DEVELOPMENT CARDS
********************************************************************************

1. Don't Count on Victory Points
    - Those resources you spend could definitely be better spend on building
      other things. Victory points are nice when you obtain them, but don't
      count on drawing them.

2. Don't Use Knights Too Early
    - Save them to keep the robber off your hexes
    - Since you can only use one dev card per turn, if you're going for largest
      army, keep that in mind.

3. Early Game?
    - In general, don't draw too many early on. If you get a victory point, it
      can really hurt your future development since it adds nothing, and growth
      is exponential.

4. Save Road Building if you can

5. Consider Dev Cards If You Can't Build

6. Knights are helpful, since 7 is rolled only once every 6 turns on average.

********************************************************************************
TRADING
********************************************************************************

1. Trading early is usually better

2. Try to trade on your turn or close to your turn

3. Trade with those far away from their turn

4. Trade with those who are losing

********************************************************************************
ROBBER PLACEMENT
********************************************************************************

1. Place it on a resource that you already have a supply of, or someone who is
   ahead, or someone who has a resource you need

2. Place it on a hex with fewer people, so it stays there longer.
